For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).

The requirement to complete this project is, as the name suggests, using the Twitch API. However, due to problems stated in the [challenge description](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/use-the-twitchtv-json-api), I've not used the API.

There's a solution given to this, but instead of the big array to be added as a `.json` file, I broke it down into a simpler smaller array.

The project is complete and you can view it on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/NAPOLEON039/full/RyEMgL/).
